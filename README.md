# Language Model Fine-tuning Best Practice

We are following the Paper [Universal Language Model Fine-tuning for Text ClassiÔ¨Åcation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.06146).
We have implemented the STLR and Layer-wise learning rate adaption using PyTorch.

The whole project is organized under PyTorch Lightning framework.
